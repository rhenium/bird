bird (1.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Upstream upgrade notes:
  
  For OSPF, there are deep internal changes, but user-visible changes
  are limited to log messages and minor changes in formatting of command
  output.

  For BGP, version 1.5.0 is essentially a minor release. There are two
  deprecated options ('start delay time' and 'route limit') and some
  minor formatting changes.

bird (1.3.11-5) unstable; urgency=low

  BIRD now uses privilege separation to increase the security, so the daemon
  doesn't run with root privileges anymore.  This change also required to
  rework the packaging a little bit, so you need to be aware of:
  
  * The directory with configuration files had moved from /etc to /etc/bird/

  * The daemon now runs as bird:bird, the user and group can be configured
    in the /etc/bird/envvars configuration file

  * The run directory where control socket resides has been moved
    to /run/bird/
